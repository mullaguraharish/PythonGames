## Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe❌⭕ is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.

The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins🏆 the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.

## Black Jack
Blackjack is a card-based game played at casinos. The participants in this game do not compete with each other but the dealer assigned by the casino. The magic number for Blackjack is 21. 
- Players make their bets and Players are dealt 2 cards.
- Dealer is dealt 2 cards where the second card is hidden from the players.
- The objective of the game is to have a higher point total than the dealer (but no more than 21, anything over 21 is an automatic loss called a bust). If you beat the dealer in this way, you win from the casino what you bet (you also win if the dealer busts). Aces can be worth either 1 or 11; every other card is worth its face amount (face cards are worth 10).
- An initial 2 card hand composed of an ace and a face card is called a blackjack and is the best possible hand.
- After the first round of dealing, each player has the option to hit (receive more cards) or stay (no more cards). If hitting results in the player busting (total going over 21), then his or her bet is lost.
- After all the players are done hitting/staying, the dealer flips over his hidden card. If the dealer’s total is less than 17, then he or she needs to hit (receive a new card). This process repeats until the dealer’s hand either totals to 17 or more or busts (goes above 21).
- After the dealer is done, the final results are decided — if the dealer busts, then any player who did not bust earlier wins his or her bet. If the dealer does not bust, then the dealer’s total is compared to each player’s. For any player whose total is greater than the dealer’s, he or she wins money. For any player whose total is less than the dealer’s, he or she loses money. No money is exchanged in the event of a tie.
